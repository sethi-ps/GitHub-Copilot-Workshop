# Lesson 4: Improving our code using GitHub Copilot

In this lesson, we'll learn how we can use GitHub Copilot CHat to implement code improvements.

This includes improvements such as code quality, code reliability, code performance, and code security. This lesson will teach you how to craft prompts to GitHub Copilot that generate suggestions for specific improvement areas.

We'll go through a couple of exercises that show you how we can craft prompts that generate suggestions for specific improvement areas, as well as demonstrate how to implement code up suggestions, accelerate the development process, and improve the quality of our code.

By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to:

- Use GitHub Copilot to improve your code.
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to increase the quality of your code.
- Improve code reliability and performance with GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Improve code security with GitHub Copilot Chat
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to debug issues in our code.

## Improving our code 

The overall theme of this workshop is to remind you that GitHub Copilot is just a Copilot at the end of the day. **You are in the driving seat**. Without AI tools, improve our code requires time and experience:

- **Time**: Implementing improvements in our code can take a long time. We need to analyze the code, identify areas for improvement and then implement the changes. This can be time consuming, especially for large, complex, codebases. We're all under the pump when it comes to timelines, and more often than not, code improvements are left behind in favour of releases.
- **Experience**: 

However, with GitHub Copilot, we can improve our code using effective prompts to GitHub Copilot which has the ability to evaluate and implement updates to our code.

### Exercise 1: Using GitHub Copilot Chat to improve our code

We use prompts to communicate our intent to GitHub Copilot. This requires us to have a clear understanding of what we want to achieve. Keep your prompts **concise, specific, and focused**.
