# Lesson 4: Improving our code using GitHub Copilot

In this lesson, we'll learn how we can use GitHub Copilot CHat to implement code improvements.

This includes improvements such as code quality, code reliability, code performance, and code security. This lesson will teach you how to craft prompts to GitHub Copilot that generate suggestions for specific improvement areas. We'll learn how GitHub Copilot can help us improve our code in the following ways:

- **Code quality**: Enhance the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code.
- **Code reliability**: Improve the robustness, error handling, and stability of your code.
- **Code performance**: Optimize the speed, memory usage, and efficiency of your code.
- **Code security**: Enhance the security, privacy, and protection of your code and data.

We'll go through a couple of exercises that show you how we can craft prompts that generate suggestions for specific improvement areas, as well as demonstrate how to implement code up suggestions, accelerate the development process, and improve the quality of our code.

By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to:

- Use GitHub Copilot to improve your code.
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to increase the quality of your code.
- Improve code reliability and performance with GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Improve code security with GitHub Copilot Chat
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to debug issues in our code.

## Improving our code 

The overall theme of this workshop is to remind you that GitHub Copilot is just a Copilot at the end of the day. **You are in the driving seat**. Without AI tools, improve our code requires time and experience:

- **Time**: Implementing improvements in our code can take a long time. We need to analyze the code, identify areas for improvement and then implement the changes. This can be time consuming, especially for large, complex, codebases. We're all under the pump when it comes to timelines, and more often than not, code improvements are left behind in favour of releases.
- **Experience**: GitHub Copilot makes coding easier, but we still have to know the fundamentals of software development, how our editor works, best practices etc. This experience helps us determine the quality of suggestions that GitHub Copilot provide.

With this in mind, let's take a look at the ways we can use GitHub Copilot to improve our code.

### Improving the quality of our code

GitHub Copilot can suggest improvements to our code, such as refactoring, suggesting design patterns, or enchancing our coding style. These suggestions can help us write code that is cleaner, maintainable, and follows best practice.

Here's some example prompts that you could use to improve the quality of your code:

- `Suggest refactoring updates to enhance the modularity of the Book class`
- `Provide design pattern suggestions to improve the internal structure of the BookService class`
- `Recommend code style enhancements to make the BookController class more readable`

### Improving the reliability of our code

GitHub Copilot can help us to make our code more reliable. This can include things such as better error handling, more robust input validation or enhanced exception handling. This helps us handle edge cases and unexpected conditions that we could potentially encounter more effectively.

Some prompts that you might use to improve code reliability could include:

- `Suggest better error handling strategies for the BookService class`
- `Improve input validation in the LoginForm class to prevent invalid input`
- `Enhance exception handling in the BookDbRepository class to handle exceptions more gracefully`

### Improving the performance of our code

We can use GitHub Copilot to optimize our code. Maybe we need to improve the performance of an algorithm, reduce the amount of memory used, or improve the execution of our code.

Some prompts that we can use to improve the performance of our code:

- `Optimize the sorting algorithm in the GetBookList method to improve performance`
- `How can I reduce the memory usage in the GetBookImage method to make it more efficient`

### Improving our code security

GitHub Copilot can also suggest improvements that make our code more secure. This is great when we need to think of data encryption, authentication, or preventing security vulnerabilities.

Some prompts that can help us write more secure code:

- `Show me how to implement secure authentication mechanisms in the LoginService class to prevent unauthorized access`
- `Implement exception handling in BookService that will prevent common security vulnerabilities`

### Exercise 1: Using GitHub Copilot Chat to improve our code

We use prompts to communicate our intent to GitHub Copilot. This requires us to have a clear understanding of what we want to achieve. Keep your prompts **concise, specific, and focused**.



# Challenge: Improve your code using GitHub Copilot Chat

It's now time to apply what we've learnt in this lesson to your own Todo application. We've used GitHub Copilot to create some new features, and we've also generated some unit tests to ensure that our code works as expected.

You're now going to use GitHub Copilot to improve our code. Again, how and what you improve is up to you, but here are some suggestions to get you started:

- How secure is your code? Maybe that frontend could use some authentication? How about the backend?
- How are you managing user input? Can you enter anything for the name of your todo tasks? Maybe that can be improved?
- How reliable is your code? Are there any edge cases you can think of that GitHub Copilot can help you out with?
